### How to use it ? ###
In this new version, internet connection is required to download updated bird taxonomy list, language traduction as well as location barchart data. This result in a very simple script to run. 

Everything is in the ```Script_Python.py```. You only need the ```Template_default.tex```, on which the script will write the new tex file. 

The script only create a .tex (LaTeX file), you will need to use your own tex compileur to create the pdf. Online tex editor and compilor exist. [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) is my favorite.
